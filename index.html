                <p></p>Hello! This is a website application that takes your birthday information
                    and determines the day of the week you were born, after which it generates your Akan Name based on
                    your gender. Ghanian culture gave rise to Akan names.</p>
                <p></p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries
                    such as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her
                    birth.As a matter of fact, it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, the day they were
                    born and their rank among the siblings just by their names. Read more.</p>
